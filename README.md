This project is an amateur attempt to build  Grafana on .net core + angular.

### How to use
Firstly get the sources:

    git clone https://github.com/megahoneybadger/grafana-ng.git
    cd grafana-ng

Secondly build server and client (you will need .net core for server and npm for client):

    make build
    
And finally:

    make run

It must start up the server listening on localhost:5000;
